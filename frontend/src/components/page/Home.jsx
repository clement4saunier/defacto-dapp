      DeFacts was designed in an attempt to increase trust in information.<br/><br/>
      No matter the nature of the story, article, publication or newspiece you have, 
      the guarantee that is it true is of great value.<br/><br/>
      Being mis-informed sometimes comes at great cost.<br/><br/>
      We aim to bring a Decentralized Information Verification Protocol that provides 
      a wide net of information gatherers to confirm or infirm information in the least biased way.
      The platform incentivises journalistic work of all sorts (fact-checking, data research..) 
      by pairing up three types of profiles and creating a collaborative work dynamic between them.
      <br/><br/>

      News outlets of all sizes, independent journalists, newsletter writers or any other individual can leverage
      the vast network of the internet by simply offering a bounty of their choice on a data verification or gathering task.
